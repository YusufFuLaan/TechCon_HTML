          TechCon, originally known as the Tech Innovators Conference, began in
          2005 in San Francisco as a small gathering of technology enthusiasts
          and professionals. It quickly gained a reputation for being
          cutting-edge, focusing on emerging technologies and start-up culture.
          By 2011, TechCon moved to larger venues and introduced workshops,
          hackathons, and specialized tracks in areas like cybersecurity and AI.
          In 2013, it was rebranded as TechCon to reflect its broader focus. The
          conference expanded globally from 2016, attracting a diverse group of
          speakers and attendees, and began addressing social and ethical issues
          in technology. The 2021 conference was held entirely online due to the
          COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a hybrid model in subsequent years.
          Today, TechCon is a premier technology conference, attracting over
          20,000 attendees annually and continuing to foster innovation and
          collaboration in the tech industry.
